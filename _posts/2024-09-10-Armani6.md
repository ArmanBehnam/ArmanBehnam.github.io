**Before I let go**

This is the sixth post on this blog. This is about me. The [previous](https://armanbehnam.github.io/blog/2024/08/29/Armani5) post.

Before I let go, I want you to know that every moment spent with you was a treasure that I held close to my heart.

I thought you were the answer to the quiet prayers of my soul. The melody to the song my heart had been singing silently. I thought you were the light in my darkest days, a reason for the small smiles that sometimes graced my life.

I never knew how heavy silence could feel until I faced it without you, and now every day stretches on, shaded with the weight of missing what was never mine.

The dreams I built around us crumble a little more with each passing day, whispering what could have been. My heart is so tender, so bruised with the realization that some paths are meant to be walked alone.

Armani: **As I step back now, I carry the bittersweetness of memories that will never grow old, even as they fade into the quiet background of my life.**
