This is the first post on this blog. This is about me.

In the last month, I experienced a trauma, became familiar with Nathan John Feuerstein (NF), an American rapper and now I'm a fan. Also, I came to my first camping in US, first pickle ball and spike ball games, and tens of hours of biing in the great city of Chicago.

But here, I want to talk about my fav topic which is deep understanding of truth. I want to write about the relation of my job with my passion for living. My work is about explaining complicated information to simple and understandable stuff.

(For AI enthusiasts: I am working on AI explanation which is to provide information from unstructured data neural networks).


**Disclaimer** A lot of things might change till you read the list. This is the course content according to
my semester. Professors will change and so will their teaching style. Make changes accordingly. If you like this blog and want
to see more course reviews from new departments like IRG, Management, etc, please mail them to me.
