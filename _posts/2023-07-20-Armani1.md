This is the first post on this blog. This is about me.

In the last month, I experienced a trauma, found a new best friend (Ryan), read the [A Matter of Death and Life](https://www.sup.org/books/cite/?id=33115) by Irvin D. Yalom and Marylin Yalom, became familiar with Nathan John Feuerstein (NF), an American rapper and now I'm a fan. Also, I came to my first camping in US, first pickle ball and spike ball games, and tens of hours of biking in the great city of Chicago.

But here, I want to talk about my fav topic which is deep understanding of truth. I want to write about the relation of my job with my passion for living. My work is about explaining complicated information to simple and understandable stuff (For AI enthusiasts: I am working on AI explanation which is to provide information from unstructured data neural networks). Since I was 19 years old, I was in love and always was happy that I've found the love of my life, but maybe I was wrong... Everyday I try to question my believes and my behavior, but somehow we stick to them always and don't want to be seperated from the safe person as we are.

Now, I embark on a journey of exploration and growth, navigating grief with realism and unwavering ethics. I seek wisdom from other people have faith, pray, how do they simplify their problem, and how do they pass the obstacles are the thingd I am now following.

Armani: **Life's journey is a tapestry of experiences and revelations. With an open heart and mind, I embrace the lessons life offers, continuously evolving on this beautiful voyage.**
