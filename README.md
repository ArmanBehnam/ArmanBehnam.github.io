## About

I'm a <b>third year CS PhD student</b> at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://wangbinghui.net/">Dr. Binghui Wang</a>, as a CS research scientist at IIT.
 Founding Researcher at a Quis.Inc startup pioneering **GNN-powered search technologies**. My research focuses on pushing the boundaries of Graph Neural Networks and **causal representation learning**, with breakthrough methods published at top-tier venues including **ECCV** and **NeurIPS**.

## Research Interests

- **Causal Machine Learning**: Developing theoretical frameworks for causal representation learning
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Novel architectures and explainability methods
- **Medical AI**: Applications in Alzheimer's disease research and healthcare analytics
- **Neural Causal Models**: Understanding cause-and-effect relations in complex systems

## Recent Publications

- **Measure-Theoretic Anti-Causal Representation Learning** - *NeurIPS 2025*
- **Graph Neural Network Causal Explanation via Neural Causal Models** - *ECCV 2024*
- **Causal Explanation from Mild Cognitive Impairment Progression using Graph Neural Networks** - *BIBM 2024*

## Professional Background

- **Founding Researcher** - Quis.Inc Startup (Current)
- **AI Research Scientist** - Mayo Clinic
- **Founding Head of Data Science** - Golrang Industrial Group
- **Editorial Board Member** - American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine
